# Wastefree
# What the problem is:
- Food waste is one of the biggest contributors to environmental issues.
- High food waste levels are primarily due to negligence.

# Food waste is a problem across the world,
- Households frequently forget or leave food beyond its shelf life, leading to significant waste.
- According to the UN Environment Programmeâ€™s Food Waste Index Report, over 1 billion tons of food went to waste globally in the last year [(link)](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1148036#:~:text=The%20UN%20Environment%20Programme%E2%80%99s%20Food%20Waste%20Index%20Report,overall%20at%20retail%2C%20food%20service%2C%20and%20household%20levels.).
- In the US alone, we waste about 92 billion pounds of food per year [(link)](https://www.feedingamerica.org/our-work/reduce-food-waste)


# Why our project solves this issue:

- We designed an app called Wastefree to reduce food waste and implement strategies for effectively using excessive food.
- Our app helps users keep track of pantry items using receipt data, considering unit economics, expiration dates, and meal ideas.

## Goals:
- Help users make the most of their food purchases and reduce waste.
- Support environmental sustainability and improve ecological conditions.

## Technologies used:
- Kivy (framework)
- Python (programming language)
- SQLite Database (database)
- Crypt (password hashing)
- Mindee (optical character recognition)

## User-friendly features:
- Receipt scanner: Streamlines categorization of food items from uploaded receipts.
- Manual item management: Allows users to add/remove items as needed.
- Email notifications: Alerts users about items nearing their expiration dates (within 3 days).
- Customized recipes: Provides recipe suggestions based on available ingredients to find purpose for leftover food.

# Ultimate goal:
- Position Wastefree as a tool that benefits both the planet and users by promoting resource availability and reducing food waste.
