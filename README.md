# Wastefree
We designed an app called Wastefree to help reduce food waste and implement strategies to effectively use what is identified as excessive food. The reason we decided to go down this route, in terms of the problem we choose, is the unfortunate prevalence of it in our society.
Food waste is far too common in our daily lives generally speaking and according to the UN Environment Programmeâ€™s Food Waste Index Report
in the most recent calendar year, just over 1 billion tons of food went to waste around the world (Statistic Reference: https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1148036#:~:text=The%20UN%20Environment%20Programme%E2%80%99s%20Food%20Waste%20Index%20Report,overall%20at%20retail%2C%20food%20service%2C%20and%20household%20levels.). Households in particular have a tendency
to forget about or leave food sitting long over it's shelf life, which contributes to the trashing of many edible goods as a whole. Hence,
we developed an application intended to help users stay up-to-date with all the food in their respective pantry, by using receipt data to
determine how to deal with foods based on factors such as unit economics, expiration dates, and meal implementations. Our goal is to not
only help people use their hard earned money to make the best of the foods they purchase, but to also help the environment thrive so that
the planet trends in the right direction in terms of ecological conditions. Some of the technologies or tools that we used in the process include: Kivy (framework), Python (programming language), SQLite Database (database), bcrypt (password hashing), mindee (optical character recognition).
